Chess popularity has increased exponentially due to charismatic youtubers taking up the sport for bolstering their intellectual prowess and the incredible fun that comes along playing chess. As other chess enthusiasts, I found that if you want to be better at chess then learning about chess openings is not only mandatory to progress but also makes you faster when playing blitz games. This chess-opening application reinforces the different chess opeinings so that the user can enjoy the beautiful game of chess.
