## General Info

- I wanted my first project to be something that I could use for improving my chess. Working on the app helped me dust-off my development skills and gain confidence.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

<!-- Chess popularity has increased exponentially due to charismatic youtubers taking up the sport for bolstering their intellectual prowess and the incredible fun that comes along playing chess. As other chess enthusiasts, I found that if you want to be better at chess then learning about chess openings is not only mandatory for progress but also makes you faster when playing blitz games.

This chess-opening application reinforces the different opeinings so that the user can enjoy the beautiful game of chess. After the user has studied the moves, they can test their knowledge. As it can be overhelming to remember all the moves at once, the user can take help by clicking the hint button. -->

## Features

- Dark mode
- Sound on/off
- Changing orientation from white to black side of board or vice versa
- Testing the user on their knowledge of selected opening
- Added hint button to help recalling a specific move (when in test mode)
- Added notations for convenience and better recall

## Future Iterations

- Use an API to calculate the probability of success for the specific opening
- Add drag/drop functionality to chess pieces when in test mode
